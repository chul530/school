### Due: Monday March 07, 2022 11:59 pm US Central Time
#### Created by Christopher Kinson

Grading Rubric (per question):  
2 points if complete and correct  
1 point if incomplete or incorrect  
0 points if no attempt made  


**Retrieving your work**

This and all future homework .Rmd files are written in Markdown. The .Rmd file can be rendered as an .html file for easier viewing. This and all future homework assignments are located in the **homework** directory within the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo, i.e. **stat440-sp22-course-content/homework** in GitHub. It is always recommended that you **pull** (or refresh) the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo to ensure that you have the most updated version of all course content including the homework assignments. After pulling (or refreshing) the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo, the homework file will be in the homework directory. Once you have opened the .Rmd file, you may begin writing your answers beneath each problem. Do not remove any of the original problems from the file, because that makes it more difficult for the course staff to grade your assignment. 

**Submitting your work**

In your individual student repo (named as your netID), you are to submit ***two*** files:

a. Your reproducible document file (.Rmd) which should be saved as homework#-netID.Rmd. For example, my homework 01 file would be saved as homework01-kinson2.Rmd.

b. Your rendered reproducible document file (.html) which should be saved as homework#-netID.html. For example, my homework 01 file would be saved as homework01-kinson2.html.

**Do not place your files in a sub-directory (or folder).** You have an unlimited number of submissions, but only the latest proper submission (commit and push) will be viewed and graded. **Remember the .Rmd file needs to render properly to .html before submitting.** 


***

Undergraduates are expected to complete the problems **#1-#8**. Graduate students are expected to complete all problems.

**The following problems should be completed by you as an individual. If any problem asks you a particular question, be sure to answer it completely (with code, written sentences, or both). Written sentences should not appear in code chunks or code cells. Written sentences should appear in Markdown syntax unless specifically stated otherwise.**

***Do not change anything in this file above the double line. Doing so will prevent your homework from being graded.***

**#1** (Markdown) Using Markdown syntax, make a non-numbered list with your netID in normal text as the full name in normal text as the second item.

**Answer:** 

- yc5

- Yeonchul Choi

**#2** (Personal survey, Markdown) Think about the previous two weeks (your experiences, assignments, and life).

**Answer:** 

**#3** (Loops and conditional execution, Markdown)

statement: The `for` loop can be used to handle grouped data summarization.

If the statement is true, then write TRUE below in all caps. If the statement is false, then write FALSE below in all caps.

**Answer:** 
TRUE

**#4** (Loops and conditional execution, Markdown)

statement: The **condition-controlled** loop is one in which repetitive actions are repeated for a predetermined number of times and stopped when the that number of times is reached.

If the text in bold is the term that makes the statement true, then write TRUE below in all caps. If the text in bold is the term that makes the statement false, then write FALSE below in all caps and write the correct term in bold text in a new line under FALSE.

**Answer:** 
FALSE
