c= 912108352008

d= 922116108008

e= 912107280008
newparcelnumber = c(a,b,c,d,e)
prop_url <- paste0("https://champaignil.devnetwedge.com/parcel/view/",newparcelnumber,"/2021")

boardreview <- rep(0, length(prop_url))

for (i in 1:5){ 
  boardreview[i] <- html_text(html_nodes(read_html(prop_url[i]),".text-right:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(7)"),trim=TRUE)
}

boardreview
```
Only a is larger than 50000
