Grading Rubric (per question):  
2 points if complete and correct  
1 point if incomplete or incorrect  
0 points if no attempt made  


**Retrieving your work**

This and all future homework .Rmd files are written in Markdown. The .Rmd file can be rendered as an .html file for easier viewing. This and all future homework assignments are located in the **homework** directory within the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo, i.e. **stat440-sp22-course-content/homework** in GitHub. It is always recommended that you **pull** (or refresh) the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo to ensure that you have the most updated version of all course content including the homework assignments. After pulling (or refreshing) the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo, the homework file will be in the homework directory. Once you have opened the .Rmd file, you may begin writing your answers beneath each problem. Do not remove any of the original problems from the file, because that makes it more difficult for the course staff to grade your assignment. 

**Submitting your work**

In your individual student repo (named as your netID), you are to submit ***two*** files:

a. Your reproducible document file (.Rmd) which should be saved as homework#-netID.Rmd. For example, my homework 01 file would be saved as homework01-kinson2.Rmd.

b. Your rendered reproducible document file (.html) which should be saved as homework#-netID.html. For example, my homework 01 file would be saved as homework01-kinson2.html.

**Do not place your files in a sub-directory (or folder).** You have an unlimited number of submissions, but only the latest proper submission (commit and push) will be viewed and graded. **Remember the .Rmd file needs to render properly to .html before submitting.** 


***

Undergraduates are expected to complete the problems **#1-#8**. Graduate students are expected to complete all problems.

**The following problems should be completed by you as an individual. If any problem asks you a particular question, be sure to answer it completely (with code, written sentences, or both). Written sentences should not appear in code chunks or code cells. Written sentences should appear in Markdown syntax unless specifically stated otherwise.**

***Do not change anything in this file above the double line. Doing so will prevent your homework from being graded.***

  - The dataset (a .json file) contains the 540 members of the US Congress with 6 variables ("columns") per person which includes details about the legislators' first and last names, official full name, middle name, nickname, and suffixes. According to the GovTrack, "the United States Congress has two chambers, one called the Senate and the other called the House of Representatives (or "House" for short) which share the responsibilities of the legislative process to create federal statutory law." The original source is TheUnitedStates.io and GovTrack.

**Answer:**
```{r}
library(jsonlite)
uscongress = fromJSON("https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json")
str(uscongress$name)

**#7** Import the Rental Inspection Grades Listing Data using its data URL https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/lbqe1l9a2g5lr0twk6zcwajasybekget.json. Now, print the structure of the data. This structure should match the data description below.  

  - The dataset (a .json file) contains the 1738 rental properties in Urbana with 7 variables ("columns") per property which includes details about the parcel number, address, grade, inspection date, and more. The rental properties are inspected on a rotating basis and can receive a letter grade of A, B, C, D, F, and N. The best grade is A. The original source is the City of Urbana.

str(rent)
```

**#8** (Accessing and importing data via web scraping) Web scrape the Champaign County Assessor's [website](https://champaignil.devnetwedge.com/) to extract a property's most recent Net Price (within the Sales History) in US Dollars. Extract this Net Price for the first 10 properties imported in **Problem 7** and print the resulting 10 Net Prices.

**Answer:**
```{r}
library(rvest)
pn = rent$`Parcel Number`[1:10]
url = paste0("https://champaignil.devnetwedge.com/parcel/view/",pn,"/2021")

np = rep(0, length(url))
for (i in 1:10){
  print(html_text(html_nodes(read_html(url[i]), ".text-center:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(9)
"),trim=TRUE))
}
```
**#9** (Accessing and importing data, Handling dates and times) Import the Urbana Police Incidents Data using its data URL https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/uxk757wno4yzqyqtrahwzvckjvs9ulmn, print the structure of the data, and ensure the dates and times columns are formatted properly as dates and times in R respectively. This structure should match the data description below.
